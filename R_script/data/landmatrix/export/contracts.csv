Finalized around September 2010 with a planned $300 M investment. The JV agreement outlined the roles: AMA would provide local facilitation and possibly equity, NEH (Hassan Group) would provide capital (foreign equity) and market access.

Note: This lease contract was presumably signed or at least drafted following the JV formation. However, according to AMA Group, it was never fully implemented due to difficulties in land acquisition (they claim the deal “did not push through”)

Later, a new land agreement was made in 2013 for 85 ha in Sarangani (likely via a lease or agreement with the provincial government), but details of that contract (e.g. exact terms or duration) were not published – it was arranged by local officials rather than through a national lease of public land."

It likely formalized the financing: Bahrain’s investor would invest $50 M (initial tranche) with AMA Group as partner. The signing was widely publicized and effectively confirmed the project’s go-ahead. (Soon after, AMA announced the Davao land issues, but the capital was later redirected to the Sarangani site.)

The event, attended by officials like Congressman Manny Pacquiao, signaled strong local political support for the venture, which secured an initial 85 hectares with plans to expand to 500. Although the specific contract is not public, it is inferred to be a long-term lease or usufruct agreement designed to support the banana plantation's operations for several decades.

gbSBc2hB;433;SERVICE CONTRACT NO. 58;2006-01-12;2020-10-16;;"SERVICE CONTRACT NO. 58 – WEST CALAMIAN
Project description
DOE awarded SC 58 to PNOC EC on 12 January 2006. The SC 58 block is a deep water acreage covering an area of 13,440 km2 located in offshore Northwest Palawan, between SC 38 and SC 57. Nido Petroleum Philippine Pty Ltd. farmed-in in 2006 and acquired 50% participating interest and operatorship.

Brief Background
About 6,500 km of 2D seismic data acquired in 1978 to 1996 are available in the block. To acquire new data Nido Petroleum’s facilitated a large seismic campaign in 2006 and late 2007-early 2008 generating 3,184 km 2D and 4,953 km pseudo 3D seismic data. In 2012, additional 861 km 2D seismic data was acquired. The interpretation of the seismic data resulted in the identification of several prospects and leads. To mitigate exploration risks and identify the most attractive prospect to drill additional G&G activities were conducted such as seabed coring with multi-beam bathymetry in 2010 and the seismic inversion/ amplitude versus offset project in 2011.

In January 2015, DOE granted force majeure to SC 58’s work commitments under Subphase 3 (SP3). The suspension period is effective from 15 December 2014 until the date when DOE notifies Nido Petroleum to commence exploration activities that should be in accordance to the final resolution on the arbitration proceedings between Philippines and China. Following the lifting of the suspension of all exploration activities in the West Philippine Sea on 12 October 2020, DOE lifted the SC 58 Force Majeure effective 16 October 2020.  However, due to the Covid-19 global pandemic and current oil prices, DOE approved a 1-year Force Majeure to SC 58 from 16 October 2020 to 16 October 2021.   "
cLv0IzGI;438;Joint Venture Farming Agreement (25-year) – Eco Global Bio-Oils & Local Farmers;2008;;25;"Parties: Eco Global Bio-Oils, Inc. (Sarangani Bio Corp venture) and individual landowner-farmers in Sarangani

Outgrower contract for jatropha cultivation: Farmers commit their land to jatropha for 25 years. Company provides seedlings, inputs, and training; farmers cultivate and harvest jatropha. Company guarantees purchase of jatropha seeds at ₱2.00–₂.50 per kg. Landowner or family can be employed as on-site supervisor (₱5k monthly) and local labor hired at ₱100/day. Essentially a production-sharing deal: the farmer supplies land/labor, and the company markets the product. (Many such contracts were signed in 2008–09 for pilot areas.)"

In return, the investors pledged community benefits (e.g. building school facilities and infrastructure in host communities)
BUPd5-wf;438;Land Lease Contracts – PNOC-AFC & Landowners (Malungon);2009;;10;"Terminated Agreement - intended for 10 years:

Parties: PNOC-Alternative Fuels Corp (Philippine state firm) and private landowners in Malungon, Sarangani

Lease of 37 ha for jatropha planting: PNOC-AFC entered a lease with landowners for 37 ha at ₱1,700/ha/yr. PNOC managed the planting on these lands directly (hiring local labor at ₱100/day). This was intended as a pilot/demonstration in partnership with the JV. PNOC’s contract was short-lived – by ~2010 PNOC-AFC withdrew from jatropha, and this lease was presumably canceled or not renewed"
jG2LKSIw;438;Local Lease/Service Contracts – Curcas Oil Phils. Inc. (COPI);;;;"Transfer of farming contracts / new lease agreements: In late 2010, Curcas Oil Philippines Inc. took over existing jatropha plantations. COPI honored or renewed contracts with farmers where jatropha was already planted. They also signed new lease agreements: COPI paid ₱1,000/ha annual rent and undertook field maintenance (valued ₱1,700/ha). This effectively revised the prior JV deals into more straightforward lease/service contracts. COPI’s contracts aimed to continue jatropha cultivation on a smaller scale. These agreements had no fixed end-date publicly, but COPI effectively exited around 2012 when the project was abandoned, rendering these contracts defunct.

By this sale, Itochu took ownership of all Dole’s plantations and facilities in Asia. The deal was approved by Dole shareholders and closed in 2013. This is a corporate takeover rather than a land contract, but it set the stage for plantation expansion under Itochu’s strategy.

Purpose: To support pineapple contract farming on ~1,400 ha managed by the coop. Terms: LandBank provides credit (e.g., a ₱212.8M loan in 2022) for farm inputs & equipment; Dolefil is the exclusive buyer of the co-op’s pineapples and provides technical assistance throughout the production cycle. Essentially, Dole guarantees market access and quality control, the co-op grows the fruit, and LandBank finances the operation. This MOA, first implemented in 2017, was renewed to continue the partnership, especially after the co-op recovered from prior financial troubles with LandBank’s help."
3rI0Ndcs;470;Local Land/Debt-Swap Agreements;2014;2016;;"Dolefil, during expansion, made informal deals with various individual farmers/landowners: farmers would cede use of their land (via lease or sale) and in exchange Dole would pay off their outstanding debts to banks or loan sharks. This was mentioned by Dole’s corporate affairs director: some landowners offered lands to Dole “in exchange for buying out their indebtedness”. 

These are case-specific arrangements rather than a single contract. Duration/Terms: varied – in most cases Dole then leased the land for long term after clearing the farmer’s mortgage. Such arrangements helped Dole aggregate fragmented farms into the plantation expansion. (No singular contract document, but a pattern of agreements reported in 2014.)"

The difference in dates indicates that the formal concession was granted in 2012 through Decree No. 2012/1001, but the Forest Management Plan (FMP) was established earlier, in 2002. This suggests that the area was already under a provisional forest management agreement before the legal formalization of the concession. According to the document ""Forest Conservation in Boumba-et-Ngoko"", there was a provisional agreement between 2002 and 2005, before the concession was officially granted in 2012. The FMP 2002-2031 remains in effect because management plans can be developed before the formalization of a concession and continue to apply after its allocation. The concession allows La Filière Bois (LFB) to operate until 2031, under the conditions established in the FMP."

tBvjx31d;10038;;1975;;;In 1975, President Ferdinand Marcos issued Proclamation No. 1387 which declared the disputed lands as a pasture reserve and was linked to the Yulo family. When Marcos was ousted, the YKR was among the properties sequestered by the Presidential Commission on Good Government in 1986. Administration of the ranch was transferred to the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI). YKR was renamed as the Busuanga Breeding and Experimental Stations (BBES).  In March 2010, the Supreme Court ordered the lifting of the sequestration of the YKR due to mismanagement. Following the high court’s decision, former President Gloria Arroyo issued Proclamation No. 2057 that authorized the Philippine Forest Corporation to manage the idle lands covered by the pasture reserve. The YKR was once again brought to public attention when it was reported that the land was  among Arroyo’s “midnight deals.” At least 2,000 hectares of forest land and beach-front property was leased to New San Jose Builders, whose owner Jerry Acuzar is the brother-in-law of President Aquino’s executive secretary Paquito Ochoa Jr. In 2013, Aquino, by virtue of Proclamation 663, transferred the administration of YKR, now referred to as Busuanga Pasture Reserve, to the Forest Management Bureau, an attached agency under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

The JVA is valid for a period of twenty-five (25) years, unless otherwise terminated by the mutual agreement of both parties. The JVA may be renewed for another twenty-five (25) years upon the filing by Lionheart of an application for renewal at least six (6) months prior to its expiration.

In the JVA, it is also specified that the indigenous people would be paid for the rent of their land, but no exact technical descriptions are provided on the boundaries of the parcel of land being stipulated in the agreement."
